Empowering Providence's Entrepreneurial Spirit

At the Slater Fund, we're on a mission to revitalize the heart of Providence, one entrepreneur at a time. As a local organization dedicated to supporting small businesses, we've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of investing in our community's visionaries.

Take Maria, for example. After years of working tirelessly to launch her sustainable fashion line, Maria found herself at a crossroads, unsure of how to take her business to the next level. That's where the Slater Fund stepped in, providing the crucial funding and mentorship she needed to expand her operations and create new jobs right here in Providence.

"The Slater Fund didn't just believe in my dream â€“ they gave me the tools to make it a reality," Maria shares. "Their support has been instrumental in helping my business grow and thrive in the city I love."

Stories like Maria's are why the Slater Fund exists. We're committed to empowering local entrepreneurs and revitalizing our community, one small business at a time. By investing in the bold ideas and entrepreneurial spirit of Providence's residents, we're driving economic growth and creating lasting change.
