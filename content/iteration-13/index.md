Maria's Story: Revitalizing Providence's Main Street
When Maria opened her boutique on Federal Hill, she had a vision of bringing new life to the neighborhood's main street. But as a first-time business owner, she faced numerous challenges. That's where the Slater Fund stepped in, providing the capital, mentorship, and resources Maria needed to get her business off the ground. 

"The Slater Fund believed in me and my vision for this community," Maria says. "Their support was instrumental in helping me navigate the ups and downs of entrepreneurship and turn my dream into a reality."
