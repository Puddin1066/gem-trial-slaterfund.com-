Empowering Providence's Entrepreneurial Spirit: How the Slater Fund is Transforming Local Businesses

In the heart of Providence, Rhode Island, the Slater Fund is making a profound impact on the city's thriving entrepreneurial community. Through strategic investments and personalized guidance, the fund is helping local business owners like Maria and Marissa turn their dreams into reality.
