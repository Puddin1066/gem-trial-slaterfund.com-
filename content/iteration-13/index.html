Empowering Providence's Entrepreneurial Spirit

At the Slater Fund, we're on a mission to ignite the entrepreneurial flame in our beloved city of Providence, Rhode Island. As a community-focused organization, we're dedicated to supporting local business owners and innovators who are driving economic growth and revitalization in our neighborhoods.

Meet Maria and Marissa - two inspiring entrepreneurs who have transformed their dreams into thriving realities with the help of the Slater Fund. 

Maria's Story: Revitalizing Providence's Main Street
When Maria opened her boutique on Federal Hill, she had a vision of bringing new life to the neighborhood's main street. But as a first-time business owner, she faced numerous challenges. That's where the Slater Fund stepped in, providing the capital, mentorship, and resources Maria needed to get her business off the ground. 

"The Slater Fund believed in me and my vision for this community," Maria says. "Their support was instrumental in helping me navigate the ups and downs of entrepreneurship and turn my dream into a reality."

Today, Maria's boutique is a vibrant hub, attracting locals and visitors alike to the revitalized main street. Her success is a testament to the Slater Fund's commitment to empowering Providence's entrepreneurial spirit.
